I am a Research Scientist at Facebook. My research interest lies broadly in machine learning and algorithms, especially in the area of privacy-preserving data analysis. Specifically, I am interested in studying the trade-off between privacy and the other resources when performing fundamental statistical tasks.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), where I was extremely fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jayadev Acharya](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/acharya/). 

In Summer 2020, I was working as a Research Scientist Intern at Facebook, where I was extremely lucky to work with [Meisam Hejazi Nia](http://www.hejazinia.com), and [Ilya Mironov](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~mironov/). In Summer 2019, I was working as a Research Intern at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/), where I was very fortunate to work with [Janardhan Kulkarni](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~kulkarni/).

I spent four wonderful years at [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/) before Cornell, graduating in 2016 with a degree in [Electronics Engineering](http://eecs.pku.edu.cn/Home/HOME.htm) and [Economics](http://en.nsd.pku.edu.cn/). At Peking University, I was extremely lucky to be advised by [Prof. Lingyang Song](http://net.pku.edu.cn/songly/index.html).
